# Transformers
## LANGUAGE TRANSLATION WITH TRANSFORMER in PYTHON
This tutorial shows, how to train a translation model from scratch using Transformer. We will be using Multi30k dataset to train a German to English translation model.

Corresponding pytorch post can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/translation_transformer.html).

This notebook is implemented based on github repo of pytorch tutorial. Repo can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/master/beginner_source/translation_transformer.py)

## keyBERT
KeyBERT is a minimal and easy-to-use keyword extraction technique that leverages BERT embeddings to create keywords and keyphrases that are most similar to a document.

Corresponding medium post can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/keyword-extraction-with-bert-724efca412ea).

This notebook is implemented based on github repo of keyBERT. Repo can be found [here](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT)

## BERTopic

BERTopic is a topic modeling technique that leverages transformers and c-TF-IDF to create dense clusters
allowing for easily interpretable topics whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions.

This notebook is implemented based on github repo of BERTopic. Repo can be found [here](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic)
